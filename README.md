# Syllable segmentation demo

This is the demo code to run the duration-informed syllable segmentation
algorithm for a singing phrase example.

To run the demo, you need to first install the  
`requirements.txt`.

Then run  
`distribute_proposed_method.py`  
to see the detected syllable onset times.
