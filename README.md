# Syllable segmentation demo

Experimented in python 3.6

This is the demo code to run the duration-informed syllable segmentation
algorithm for a singing phrase example.

If you use the code in your experiment, please cite this paper:

```
@conference {rgong2018singing,
	title = {Singing voice phoneme segmentation by hierarchically inferring syllable and phoneme onset positions},
	booktitle = {Interspeech 2018},
	year = {2018},
	month = {02/09/2018},
	address = {Hyderabad, India},
	url = {https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01665.pdf},
	author = {Rong Gong and Xavier Serra}
}
```

To run the demo, you need to first install the  
`requirements.txt`.

Then run  
`distribute_proposed_method.py`  
to see the detected syllable onset times.
